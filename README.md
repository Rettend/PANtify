# Guess The Song 2.0 rewrite

Guess The Song is an exciting music game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, whether it's at parties, in classrooms, or with family and friends. Powered by Vue.js, Vite, Windi CSS, Spotify Web API, Musixmatch API, and the WebPlayback SDK.

## Features

- The game plays short clips from songs, and players have to guess the song title and artist correctly. Players can earn bonus points by guessing the artist correctly.
- Each song comes with lyrics that players can use to guess the song. Players can earn bonus points for guessing songs without lyrics.
- With the clip mechanic each turn consists of three clips of the same song. The clips get progressively longer and easier to recognize, but players earn more points by guessing the song correctly earlier in the turn.
- The theme mechanic adds an extra level of challenge to the game. Two teams compete against each other, and before each round, one team chooses a theme for the next song. The other team then has to guess the song based on the theme. Themes can be based on the artist, genre, year, or word in the title.
